Binary Tree Sum Pair Finder Program Usage Instructions

Overview:
This program is designed to perform several operations on two separate binary trees. It constructs these trees from input data, finds pairs of nodes whose values sum up to a target value, and conducts both preorder and inorder traversals.

Requirements:
The program is written in C and should be compiled with a C compiler before running.
It is designed for use on systems with standard input and output capabilities.

Running the Program:
Use your tool like devcpp or vscode to execute the program
Provide the required input according to the program's prompts.

Input Format:
The number of nodes m in the first binary tree.
Pairs of integers for each of the m nodes, representing the node's value and the index of its father node.
The number of nodes n in the second binary tree.
Pairs of integers for each of the n nodes, identical to the first tree's input format.
The target sum value for which pairs of nodes will be sought across the two trees.

Output:
The program prints true if there is at least one pair of nodes from each tree that sums up to the target value, followed by the pairs. If no pair is found, it prints false.
After processing pairs, the program outputs the preorder traversal of both trees, each on a new line.

Input Example:
4
15 -1
3 0
22 0
10 1
3
12 -1
6 0
25 0
27

Output Example:
true
27 = 15 + 12
15 3 10 22 
12 6 25 

Cleanup:
Once the program finishes execution or before starting a new execution, ensure to clean up resources if necessary (like closing any open files, not applicable in this specific program).

Compile, run, and interact with the program according to the above instructions to work with the binary trees as described.Wish you have fun!
