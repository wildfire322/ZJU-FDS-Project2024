You can use my program by following steps.

Use your tool like devcpp or vscode to execute the program

Provide the required input according to the program's prompts.

The input can be in two forms.

One is manual input,just input 1 in "project.c"to choose mode,then give your input as specified.
Input example:
5 7
1 2 2
1 5 1
2 3 1
2 4 1
2 5 2
3 5 1
3 4 1
4
5 1 3 4 2
5 3 1 2 4
2 3 4 5 1
3 2 1 5 4

Output example:
Yes
Yes
Yes
No


The other one is to run the "generator.c" first ,then choose 2 in "project.c" to use the data randomly generated in "text.txt".Both are OK.

Then you compare the result to the expected.

All in all,compile, run, and interact with the program according to the above instructions  .Wish you have fun!
