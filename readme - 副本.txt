Program User Guide

This program is designed to measure the execution time of four different searching algorithms: iterative binary search, recursive binary search, iterative sequential search, and recursive sequential search. Below is a guide on how to use this program effectively:

1. Compilation:
    - Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
    - Compile the program with tools like Vscode or Dev
2. Execution:
    - Run the compiled program
    - Upon execution, the program will prompt you to input the size of the array.

3. Input:
    - Enter an integer value to specify the size of the array.
    - Note: Larger array sizes may result in longer execution times.

4. Output:
    - The program will output the tick count and execution time for each of the four search algorithms.
    - Tick count represents the number of clock ticks elapsed during execution.
    - Execution time is presented in seconds.

5. Interpreting Results:
    - Pay attention to the execution time of each algorithm.
    - Lower execution times indicate faster search performance.
    - Compare the performance of different algorithms to determine which one suits your needs best.

6. Repetition:
    - The program repeats each search algorithm 100,000 times to ensure accurate timing measurements.
    - This repetition helps in smoothing out variations in execution time caused by system processes.

7. Understanding Output:
    - Look for consistency in execution times across multiple runs to gauge the reliability of the measurements.
    - Note that execution times may vary based on system resources and workload.

8. Further Customization:
    - Modify the program code to adjust the number of repetitions or customize the search algorithms as needed.
    - You can experiment with different array sizes and search keys to analyze algorithm performance under various scenarios.

9. Analyses:
    - Use this program to explore and compare the efficiency of different searching algorithms.
    - Gain insights into algorithmic performance and enhance your understanding of search techniques.
